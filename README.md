This command line challenge is designed to familiarize you with the terminal. This challenge covers the most commonly used commands that any developer should know to succeed in life.

> ‚ùó We recommend that you read the lesson [The Command Line](https://4geeks.com/es/lesson/the-command-line-the-terminal-es) on the 4Geeks.com platform before doing this exercise.

üíª The challenge is designed for computers using Linux bash. Use Github Codespaces or Gitpod if you need a cloud terminal.

## üå± How to start this project

### üë©‚Äçüéì Students and Teachers should follow this step

This project comes with the necessary files to start working immediately. Inside this repository, you will find an organized folder structure to work with.

We recommend opening this same repository using a development environment like [Codespaces](https://4geeks.com/es/lesson/tutorial-de-github-codespaces) (recommended) or [Gitpod](https://4geeks.com/es/lesson/como-utilizar-gitpod).

This is the repository you need to open:

```text
https://github.com/breatheco-de/excercise-terminal-challenge.git
```
**üëâ Please follow these steps on** [how to start a coding project](https://4geeks.com/es/lesson/como-comenzar-un-proyecto-de-codificacion).

Alternatively, you can clone it to your local computer.

>‚ö†Ô∏è Before cloning, be aware of this potential issue on Windows  

On **Windows and some Linux configurations**, there is a limit on the number of characters allowed in file and folder names. If the repository has too long paths, you might encounter the error:  

> **Filename too long**  

To avoid this problem, instead of cloning the repository in the usual way, use the `--no-checkout` option, which will prevent Git from automatically extracting the long files. Then, manually checkout with these commands:  

```bash
git clone --no-checkout https://github.com/breatheco-de/exercise-terminal-challenge.git
cd exercise-terminal-challenge
git checkout HEAD --
```

> üí° Important: Remember to save and upload your code to GitHub by creating a new repository, updating the remote (`git remote set-url origin <your new url>`), and uploading the code to your new repository using the `add`, `commit`, and `push` commands from the git terminal.

## Only teachers should follow this step:

**The small challenges and interactive slides are NOT in this repository, but are deployed elsewhere.**  

To access the **interactive slides and practice challenges**, visit the following link:

If you experience any issues with the website, follow these steps after cloning or opening the following repository in Codespaces:

```text
https://github.com/breatheco-de/exercise-terminal-challenge-slides.git
```

#### 1) Install the packages.

```bash
$ npm install
```

#### 2) Run the presentation.

```bash
$ npm run start
```
